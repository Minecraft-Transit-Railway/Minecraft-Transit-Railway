	// Minecraft 1.21.11 renamed ResourceLocation back to Identifier and left it in the same
	// net.minecraft.resources package, so rewriting the token alone covers the imports, every usage
	// and the Javadoc links. That keeps roughly 150 sites free of version guards.
	//
	// The replacement is declared only for the newer targets instead of relying on a reversible
	// direction. Reversing it would rewrite unrelated names that merely contain the word, such as
	// formatIdentifier, along with a log message that mentions it in prose.
