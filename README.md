## Minecraft Transit Railway 4.0.0

_Minecraft Transit Railway_ is a [Minecraft mod](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mods) that allows you to build your own transport network with automated trains, boats, cable cars, and planes!

Version 4.0.0 is a complete rewrite from scratch. The vehicle simulation code has been separated from the Minecraft instance, greatly reducing lag on Minecraft servers.

## Major Features in 4.0.0

- Custom train configuration
- Realistic bogies and train movement
- Improved signalling
- Sideways elevators
- OBJ features ported over from Nemo's Transit Expansion
- Vehicle swaying effect
- New online system map and OneBusAway integration
- Client-side FPS improvements and server-side TPS improvements
